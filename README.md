## Blinkit Grocery Dashboard (using EXCEL):
To design an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights into BlinkIT’s grocery sales, customer behavior, and product performance. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making by visualizing key metrics such as revenue trends, category-wise sales, top-performing products, customer demographics, and operational efficiency.
In short, it’s about:
- Tracking performance → sales, orders, revenue, margins
- Understanding customers → preferences, buying patterns
- Optimizing operations → inventory, delivery, category contribution
- Supporting decisions → marketing, pricing, and supply chain strategies
Would you like me to draft a one-line project objective statement (like for a report or presentation), or a slightly detailed version (like for a project proposal)?
